<dd>The purpose of a honeypot is to refine an organization's intrusion detection system (IDS) and threat response<br> so it is in a better position to manage and prevent attacks. There are two primary kinds of honeypots: production and research Improve intrusion detection and threat response
    Honeypots help organizations refine their intrusion detection systems and threat response to better manage and prevent attacks.
    Gather information about attackers
    Honeypots can help organizations learn about attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures. This information can help organizations identify potential vulnerabilities in their systems and prioritize security efforts.
    Reduce risk of false positives
    Honeypots are less likely to attract legitimate activity than traditional cybersecurity measures. 
    There are two main types of honeypots:
    Production honeypots
    Used by large organizations as an active defense to identify compromises in their internal networks.
    Research honeypots
    Used by governments or large cybersecurity organizations to track the development of advanced persistent threats. 
    Honeypots can be applied to any computing resource, including software, networks, file servers, and routers..</dd><br>
